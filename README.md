## 📂 Protocol Overview

This repository contains the source code for **J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) - The 2025 Upgrade**. 

Moving beyond simple `if/else` command loops, this version leverages modern **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Neural Voice Synthesis**, and advanced **OS Automation** to create a truly conversational and functional AI assistant. It is designed to handle system tasks, retrieve real-time data, and manage IoT devices, all while maintaining the personality of Tony Stark's legendary assistant.

## ⚡ Key Features (Mark 2025)

*   **🧠 Advanced LLM Core**: Integrated with OpenAI (GPT-4) or Ollama (Llama 3) for context-aware, human-like conversation. No more robotic hard-coded responses.
*   **🗣️ Hyper-Realistic TTS**: Uses ElevenLabs/Edge-TTS for voice output that sounds exactly like the movie version.
*   **👂 Whisper-Fast Listening**: Implements OpenAI Whisper for real-time, high-accuracy speech-to-text processing.
*   **💻 Total System Control**: Automate opening apps, organizing files, locking the PC, and adjusting volume via voice.
*   **🌐 Real-Time Intelligence**: Web scraping capabilities to fetch news, weather, stock prices, and specific queries instantly.
*   **🏠 IoT & Smart Home**: (In Progress) Integration with Home Assistant to control lights and smart devices.
